# LinearRegression_HandsOn
We will construct a linear model that can predict a car's mileage (mpg) by using its other attributes.
Data Description: 

The dataset has 9 variables, including the name of the car and its various attributes like horsepower, weight, region of origin, etc. Missing values in the data are marked by a series of question marks.

A detailed description of the variables is given below.

1. mpg: miles per gallon
2. cylinders: number of cylinders
3. displacement: engine displacement in cubic inches
4. horsepower: horsepower of the car
5. weight: weight of the car in pounds
6. acceleration: time taken, in seconds, to accelerate from O to 60 mph
7. model year: year of manufacture of the car (modulo 100)
8. origin: region of origin of the car (1 - American, 2 - European, 3 - Asian)
9. car name: name of the car
